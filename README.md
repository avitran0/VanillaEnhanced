This mod adds a few things to enhance the Vanilla experience.  
If you have any suggestions for new things, feel free to send me a message or open an issue.

## I need new sprites for this mod, I am unable to make my own, if you want to make any, please contact me

## V6.0 only, there is no backwards compatibility for older versions

This is not because i'm lazy, but because of the major changes of V6.
